RFC Archive
====================

This folder is used to archive all RFCs contributed by OPEA community. The files under this folder are automatically generated by scanning each OPEA repository's `Issues` page and extracting all discussions matched with the `[RFC]: xxx` string pattern in title.

The file naming convention follows this rule: [project_name]-yy-mm-dd-index-title.md

For example, GenAIExamples-24-04-29-001-Using_MicroService_to_implement_ChatQnA.md
